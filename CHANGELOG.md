# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Explore page**: Explore promoted from a modal tab to an independent page with My Skills / Explore top-level navigation.
- **Featured skills**: Explore page displays curated skills from ClawHub API (updated daily via GitHub Actions) with frontend filtering and one-click install.
- **Online skill search**: Real-time search via skills.sh API (triggered at 2+ characters, 500ms debounce), results deduplicated against the featured list and shown in separate sections.
- **Skill detail view**: Click a skill name to browse its files with a file tree, Markdown rendering (GFM + frontmatter stripping), and syntax highlighting (40+ languages, light/dark theme adaptive).
- **Skill description field**: Description extracted from SKILL.md frontmatter at install time, stored in database, and displayed on My Skills cards.
- **GitHub Token setting**: Optional GitHub Token input in settings to increase API rate limit from 60 to 5,000 requests/hour.
- **MoltBot tool adapter**: Added standalone MoltBot tool support after OpenClaw rename/split.

### Fixed
- Git install deriving skill name as "skills" when URL points to a `skills/` subdirectory, causing duplicated sync paths ([#28](https://github.com/qufei1993/skills-hub/issues/28)).
- GitHub API rate-limit errors now display the exact reset time instead of a generic message.
- Windows "Access Denied" OS error 5 when syncing to tools ([#20](https://github.com/qufei1993/skills-hub/issues/20)).
- Git repo directory structures not correctly recognized as skills ([#18](https://github.com/qufei1993/skills-hub/issues/18), [#8](https://github.com/qufei1993/skills-hub/issues/8)).
- Repos using `.claude/skills/` directory format not detected ([#27](https://github.com/qufei1993/skills-hub/issues/27)).
- OpenClaw path updated from `.moltbot/skills` to `.openclaw/skills` ([#29](https://github.com/qufei1993/skills-hub/issues/29)).

### Changed
- My Skills list: tool badges now only show synced tools, collapsing to `+N more` beyond 5.
- Manual Add modal simplified to Local Directory / Git Repository tabs only (Explore tab removed).
- Multi-skill repo online install now auto-matches target skill (exact → unique-contains → fallback to manual picker).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **Windows platform support**: Full support for Windows build and release (thanks @jrtxio [PR#6](https://github.com/qufei1993/skills-hub/pull/6)).
- Support and display for many new tools (e.g., Kimi Code CLI, Augment, OpenClaw, Cline, CodeBuddy, Command Code, Continue, Crush, Junie, iFlow CLI, Kiro CLI, Kode, MCPJam, Mistral Vibe, Mux, OpenClaude IDE, OpenHands, Pi, Qoder, Qwen Code, Trae/Trae CN, Zencoder, Neovate, Pochi, AdaL).
- UI confirmation and linked selection for tools that share the same global skills directory.
- Local import multi-skill discovery aligned with Git rules, with a selection list and invalid-item reasons.
- New local import commands for listing candidates and installing a selected subpath with SKILL.md validation.

### Changed
- Antigravity global skills directory updated to `~/.gemini/antigravity/global_skills`.
- OpenCode global skills directory corrected to `~/.config/opencode/skills`.
- Tool status now includes `skills_dir`; frontend tool list/sync is driven by backend data and deduped by directory.
- Sync/unsync now updates records across tools sharing a skills directory to avoid duplicate filesystem work and inconsistent state.
- Local import flow now scans candidates first; single valid candidate installs directly, multi-candidate opens selection.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-26

### Changed
- GitHub Actions release workflow for macOS packaging and uploading `updater.json` (`.github/workflows/release.yml`).
- Cursor sync now always uses directory copy due to Cursor not following symlinks when discovering skills: https://forum.cursor.com/t/cursor-doesnt-follow-symlinks-to-discover-skills/149693/4
- Managed skill update now re-syncs copy-mode targets using copy-only overwrite, and forces Cursor targets to copy to avoid accidental relinking.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- Initial release of Skills Hub desktop app (Tauri + React).
- Central repository for Skills; sync to multiple AI coding tools (symlink/junction preferred, copy fallback).
- Local import from folders.
- Git import via repository URL or folder URL (`/tree/<branch>/<path>`), with multi-skill selection and batch install.
- Sync and update: copy-mode targets can be refreshed; managed skills can be updated from source.
- Migration intake: scan existing tool directories, import into central repo, and one‑click sync.
- New tool detection and optional sync.
- Basic settings: storage path, language, and theme.
- Git cache with cleanup (days) and freshness window (seconds).

### Build & Release
- Local packaging scripts for macOS (dmg), Windows (msi/nsis), Linux (deb/appimage).
- GitHub Actions build validation and tag-based draft releases (release notes pulled from `CHANGELOG.md`).

### Performance
- Git import and batch install optimizations: cached clones reduce repeated fetches; timeouts and non‑interactive git improve stability.
